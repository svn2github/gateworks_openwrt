Instructions for building the OpenWrt based BSP with Gateworks Patches

---------------
Pre-requisites:
---------------
  - OpenWrt buildroot prerequisites listed at
    http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence

----------------
Simple Procedure
----------------

A makefile is provided in this directory to simplify the process of fetching,
patching, and preparing the OpenWrt tree to be built for the Gateworks
products.  The following make targets exist:

trunk    : fetch, patch, and prepare the version of the OpenWrt trunk this
           patchset has been tested with
all      : build BSP for all supported Gateworks product families
cns3xxx  : build BSP for the cns3xxx target (Laguna product family)
ixp4xx   : build BSP for the cns3xxx target (Avila/Cambria product family)
images   : build binary flash images (suitable for JTAG flashing) for
           supported product families (Laguna).
dirclean : remove all downloaded and built directories

For example, if you wish to build the BSP for a GW2380 (in the Laguna family):
  make cns3xxx  ;# build kernel/rootfs
  make images   ;# fetch latest bootloader and create a flash image for JTAG

The resulting kernel/rootfs will be in the trunk/bin/cns3xxx directory and
the resulting flash firmware image will be images/gw2380.bin.
