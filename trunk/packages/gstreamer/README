These packages are still a work-in-progress and intended for the
Gateworks GW2361 Rincon product family.  The intention is to replace the
monolithic and dated ti-tools package at
http://svn.gateworks.com/bsp/rincon/trunk/packages/ti-tools with a set of
packages that better integrate with upgstream gstreamer packages as well
as to make it clear where the sources come from and what patches are applied.

Some of these packages override those in upstream OpenWRT which will
eventually be submitted upstream.

To use these make sure you add a feed for them in feeds.conf/feeds.conf.default
the preceeds svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages

Todo:
 - investigate moving SDKPATHS to a common include file
 - fix missing repating pre-amble from h264 stream
 - Split out cetools from ti-ce package
 - reconcile differences from what is bundled in ti-tools
 - evaluate updates of various components
